# Mike Bianco's Dotfiles

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
```

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./osx.sh
```

Also, there is a very opinionated set of dev apps, setting, etc available by running:

```bash
./brew.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

* [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
* [Gianni Chiappetta](http://gf3.ca/) for sharing his [amazing collection of dotfiles](https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles)
* [Matijs Brinkhuis](http://hotfusion.nl/) and his [homedir repository](https://github.com/matijs/homedir)
* [Jan Moesen](http://jan.moesen.nu/) (who will hopefully take [his `.bash_profile`](https://gist.github.com/1156154) and make it into a full `dotfiles` repo some day)
